Description: Enables small area estimation (SAE) of health and demographic indicators in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It powers an R 'shiny' application for generating subnational estimates and prevalence maps of 150+ binary indicators from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). It builds on the SAE analysis workflow from the 'surveyPrev' package. For documentation, visit <https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/>. Methodological details can be found at Wu et al.
