Description: Enables small area estimation (SAE) of health and demographic indicators in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It powers an R 'shiny' application that helps public health analysts, policymakers, and researchers generate subnational estimates and prevalence maps for 150+ binary indicators from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Basing its core SAE analysis workflow on the 'surveyPrev' package, the app ensures methodological rigor through guided model selection, automated fitting, and interactive visualization.
